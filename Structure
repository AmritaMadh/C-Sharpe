 can include constructors, constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, events & nested types.
 cannot have explict parameterless constructor or a destructor.
 can implement interfaces, same as class.
 cannot inherit another structure or class, and it cannot be the base of a class.
 members cannot be specified as abstract, sealed, virtual, or protected.
 members are called using new keyword.

Diffrence:
Structures are value types which are faster for samll data and good for gaming
where as Classess are reference types which are good for large data

Why a struct does not declare a default constructor?
Because copies of structs are created and destroyed automatically by the compiler, a default constructor and destructor are unnecessary. In effect, the compiler implements the 
default constructor by assigning all the fields of their default values.
