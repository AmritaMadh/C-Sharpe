Params:
specifies this may take variable number of parameters.
No additional parameters are permitted after the params keyword in a method declaration, and only one params keyword is permitted in a method declaration.

What does "Params" do? 
Using "Params", the arguments passed to a method are changed by the compiler to elements in a temporary array, and this array is then used to retrieve the method parameters by 
the caller code. What if the creator of a class does not know how many number of parameters a caller will use?
 
For example, a Student class with a method, TotalMarks that returns the sum of all marks. Each grade may have a different number of subjects and their respective marks. The 3rd 
grade may have 3 subjects only. The 8th grade may have 4 subjects while a 9th grade may have 5 subjects. We can use params in this case and pass 3, 4, and 5 comma separated values. 
 
 
Why we use "Params" in C#?
As I said earlier, params keyword in C# can be used to declare method that does not know the number of parameters. Parmas are also useful to write "clean code". Instead of using 
various overloaded methods to pass multiple values, we can simply create an array and pass it as an arugment or a comma separated list of values. 
Let's say, we have a class, Student. It has two methods, TotalMarks and AllSubjects. Each of these methods take a parameter of type params. As you can see from the below code, 
params is an array.

Named Parameter
 
Named Parameters allow developers to pass a method arguments with parameter names. Prior to these this feature, the method parameters were passed using a sequence only.
Now, using named parameters in C#, we can put any parameter in any sequence as long as the name is there. The right parameber value based on their names will be mapped to the 
right variable. The parameters name must match with the method definition parameter names.
